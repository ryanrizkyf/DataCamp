    "# Best Practices\n",
    "The goal of this course is to transform you into a Python expert, and so the first chapter starts off with best practices when writing functions. You'll cover docstrings and why they matter and how to know when you need to turn a chunk of code into a function. You will also learn the details of how Python passes arguments to functions, as well as some common gotchas that can cause debugging headaches when calling functions."

    "### 1. Crafting a Docstring\n",
    "\n",
    " You've decided to write the world's greatest open-source natural language processing Python package. It will revolutionize working with free-form text, the way numpy did for arrays, pandas did for tabular data, and scikit-learn did for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    " The first function you write is count_letter(). It takes a string and a single letter and returns the number of times the letter appears in the string. You want the users of your open-source package to be able to understand how this function works easily, so you will need to give it a docstring. Build up a Google Style docstring for this function by following these steps.\n",
    " \n",
    " Instructions:\n",
    " 1. Copy the following string and add it as the docstring for the function: Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.\n",
    " 2. Now add the arguments section, using the Google style for docstrings. Use str to indicate a string.\n",
    " 3. Add a returns section that informs the user the return value is an int.\n",
    " 4. Finally, add some information about the ValueError that gets raised when the arguments aren't correct."

That way, the user doesn't have to go elsewhere to look up the documentation for the function they are trying to use. You've been asked to complete the build_tooltip() function that retrieves a docstring from an arbitrary function.\n",
