    "### 12. Inner Working of Lists\n",
    "\n",
    " At the end of the video, Hugo explained how Python lists work behind the scenes. \n",
    " In this exercise you'll get some hands-on experience with this.\n",
    "\n",
    " The Python code in the script already creates a list with the name areas and a copy named areas_copy. \n",
    " Next, the first element in the areas_copy list is changed and the areas list is printed out. \n",
    " If you hit Run Code you'll see that, although you've changed areas_copy, the change also takes effect in the areas list. \n",
    " That's because areas and areas_copy point to the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    " If you want to prevent changes in areas_copy from also taking effect in areas, you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the areas list. \n",
    " You can do this with list() or by using [:].\n",
    "\n",
    " Instructions:\n",
    " - Change the second command, that creates the variable areas_copy, such that areas_copy is an explicit copy of areas. \n",
    " - After your edit, changes made to areas_copy shouldn't affect areas. Submit the answer to check this."
