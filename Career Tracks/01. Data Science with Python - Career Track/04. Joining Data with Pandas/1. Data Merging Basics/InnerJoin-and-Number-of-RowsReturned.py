# All of the merges you have studied to this point are called inner joins. 
# It is necessary to understand that inner joins only return the rows with matching values in both tables. 
# You will explore this further by reviewing the merge between the wards and census tables, 
# then comparing it to merges of copies of these tables that are slightly altered, named wards_altered, and census_altered. 
# The first row of the wards column has been changed in the altered tables. 
# You will examine how this affects the merge between them. 
# The tables have been loaded for you.

# For this exercise, it is important to know that the wards and census tables start with 50 rows.

wards = pd.read_csv('ward.csv')
census = pd.read_csv('census.csv')

# Instructions
# Merge wards and census on the ward column and save the result to wards_census.
# Merge the wards_altered and census tables on the ward column, and notice the difference in returned rows.
# Merge the wards and census_altered tables on the ward column, and notice the difference in returned rows.

# Merge the wards and census tables on the ward column
wards_census = wards.merge(census, on='ward')

# Print the shape of wards_census
print('wards_census table shape:', wards_census.shape)

# Print the first few rows of the wards_altered table to view the change 
print(wards_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards_altered and census tables on the ward column
wards_altered_census = wards_altered.merge(census, on='ward')

# Print the shape of wards_altered_census
print('wards_altered_census table shape:', wards_altered_census.shape)

# Print the first few rows of the census_altered table to view the change 
print(census_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards and census_altered tables on the ward column
wards_census_altered = wards.merge(census_altered, on='ward')

# Print the shape of wards_census_altered
print('wards_census_altered table shape:', wards_census_altered.shape)
