# To solidify the concept of a three DataFrame merge, practice another exercise. 
# A reasonable extension of our review of Chicago business data would include looking at demographics information about the neighborhoods where the businesses are. 
# A table with the median income by zip code has been provided to you. 
# You will merge the licenses and wards tables with this new income-by-zip-code table called zip_demo.

# The licenses, wards, and zip_demo DataFrames have been loaded for you.

zip_demo = pd.read_csv('zip_demo.csv')

# Instructions
# Starting with the licenses table, merge to it the zip_demo table on the zip column. 
# Then merge the resulting table to the wards table on the ward column. 
# Save result of the three merged tables to a variable named licenses_zip_ward.
# Group the results of the three merged tables by the column alderman and find the median income.

# Merge licenses and zip_demo, on zip; and merge the wards on ward
licenses_zip_ward = licenses.merge(zip_demo, on='zip') \
            			.merge(wards, on='ward')

# Print the results by alderman and show median income
print(licenses_zip_ward.groupby('alderman').agg({'income':'median'}))
