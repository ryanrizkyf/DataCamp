# In this exercise, assume that you are looking to start a business in the city of Chicago. 
# Your perfect idea is to start a company that uses goats to mow the lawn for other businesses. 
# However, you have to choose a location in the city to put your goat farm. 
# You need a location with a great deal of space and relatively few businesses and people around to avoid complaints about the smell. 
# You will need to merge three tables to help you choose your location. 
# The land_use table has info on the percentage of vacant land by city ward. 
# The census table has population by ward, and the licenses table lists businesses by ward.

# The land_use, census, and licenses tables have been loaded for you.

# Instructions
# Merge land_use and census on the ward column. 
# Merge the result of this with licenses on the ward column, using the suffix _cen for the left table and _lic for the right table. 
# Save this to the variable land_cen_lic.
# Group land_cen_lic by ward, pop_2010 (the population in 2010), and vacant, then count the number of accounts. Save the results to pop_vac_lic.
# Sort pop_vac_lic by vacant, account, andpop_2010 in descending, ascending, and ascending order respectively. Save it as sorted_pop_vac_lic.

# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use.merge(census, on='ward') \
                    .merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=('_cen','_lic'))

# Group by ward, pop_2010, and vacant, then count the # of accounts
pop_vac_lic = land_cen_lic.groupby(['ward','pop_2010','vacant'], 
                                   as_index=False).agg({'account':'count'})

# Sort pop_vac_lic and print the results
sorted_pop_vac_lic = pop_vac_lic.sort_values(['vacant', 'account', 'pop_2010'], 
                                             ascending=[False, True, True])

# Print the top few rows of sorted_pop_vac_lic
print(sorted_pop_vac_lic.head())
