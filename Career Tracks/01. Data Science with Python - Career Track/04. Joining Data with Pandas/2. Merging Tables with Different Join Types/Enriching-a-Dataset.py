# Setting how='left' with the .merge()method is a useful technique for enriching or enhancing a dataset with additional information from a different table. 
# In this exercise, you will start off with a sample of movie data from the movie series Toy Story. 
# Your goal is to enrich this data by adding the marketing tag line for each movie. 
# You will compare the results of a left join versus an inner join.

# The toy_story DataFrame contains the Toy Story movies. The toy_story and taglines DataFrames have been loaded for you.

# Instructions
# Merge toy_story and taglines on the id column with a left join, and save the result as toystory_tag.
# With toy_story as the left table, merge to it taglines on the id column with an inner join, and save as toystory_tag.

# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a left join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id', how='left')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)

# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a inner join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)
