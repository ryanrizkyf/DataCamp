# It is time to put together many of the aspects that you have learned in this chapter. 
# In this exercise, you'll find out which movie sequels earned the most compared to the original movie. 
# To answer this question, you will merge a modified version of the sequels and financials tables where their index is the movie ID. 
# You will need to choose a merge type that will return all of the rows from the sequels table, 
# and not all the rows of financials table need to be included in the result. 
# From there, you will join the resulting table to itself so that you can compare the revenue values of the original movie to the sequel. 
# Next, you will calculate the difference between the two revenues and sort the resulting dataset.

# The sequels and financials tables have been provided.

# Instructions
# With the sequels table on the left, merge to it the financials table on index named id, 
# ensuring that all the rows from the sequels are returned and some rows from the other table may not be returned, Save the results to sequels_fin.
# Merge the sequels_fin table to itself with an inner join, 
# where the left and right tables merge on sequel and id respectively with suffixes equal to ('_org','_seq'), saving to orig_seq.
# Select the title_org, title_seq, and diff columns of orig_seq and save this as titles_diff.
# Sort by titles_diff by diff in descending order and print the first few rows.

# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on sequel and right on id
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how='inner', left_on='sequel', 
                             right_on='id', right_index=True,
                             suffixes=('_org','_seq'))

# Add calculation to subtract revenue_org from revenue_seq 
orig_seq['diff'] = orig_seq['revenue_seq'] - orig_seq['revenue_org']

# Select the title_org, title_seq, and diff 
titles_diff = orig_seq[['title_org','title_seq','diff']]

# Print the first rows of the sorted titles_diff
print(titles_diff.sort_values(by='diff', ascending=False).head())
