# Merging a table to itself can be useful when you want to compare values in a column to other values in the same column. 
# In this exercise, you will practice this by creating a table that for each movie will list the movie director and a member of the crew on one row. 
# You have been given a table called crews, which has columns id, job, and name. 
# First, merge the table to itself using the movie ID. 
# This merge will give you a larger table where for each movie, every job is matched against each other. 
# Then select only those rows with a director in the left table, and avoid having a row where the director's job is listed in both the left and right tables. 
# This filtering will remove job combinations that aren't with the director.

# The crews table has been loaded for you.

# Instructions
# To a variable called crews_self_merged, merge the crews table to itself on the id column using an inner join, 
# setting the suffixes to '_dir' and '_crew' for the left and right tables respectively.
# Create a Boolean index, named boolean_filter, 
# that selects rows from the left table with the job of 'Director' and avoids rows with the job of 'Director' in the right table.
# Use the .head() method to print the first few rows of direct_crews.

# Merge the crews table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id', how='inner',
                                suffixes=('_dir','_crew'))

# Create a boolean index to select the appropriate rows
boolean_filter = ((crews_self_merged['job_dir'] == 'Director') & 
                  (crews_self_merged['job_crew'] != 'Director'))
direct_crews = crews_self_merged[boolean_filter]

# Print the first few rows of direct_crews
print(direct_crews.head())
