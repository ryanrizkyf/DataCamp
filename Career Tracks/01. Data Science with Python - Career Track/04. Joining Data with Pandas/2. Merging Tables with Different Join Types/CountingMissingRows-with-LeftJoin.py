# The Movie Database is supported by volunteers going out into the world, collecting data, and entering it into the database. 
# This includes financial data, such as movie budget and revenue. 
# If you wanted to know which movies are still missing data, you could use a left join to identify them. 
# Practice using a left join by merging the movies table and the financials table.

# The movies and financials tables have been loaded for you.

# Instructions
# Merge the movies table, as the left table, with the financials table using a left join, and save the result to movies_financials.
# Count the number of rows in movies_financials with a null value in the budget column.

# Merge the movies table with the financials table with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Count the number of rows in the budget column that are missing
number_of_missing_fin = movies_financials['budget'].isnull().sum()

# Print the number of movies missing financials
print(number_of_missing_fin)
