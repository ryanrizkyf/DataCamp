# In this exercise, you will practice what you've learned from the video about writing list comprehensions. 
# You will write a list comprehension and identify the output that will be produced.

# The following list has been pre-loaded in the environment.

doctor = ['house', 'cuddy', 'chase', 'thirteen', 'wilson']

# How would a list comprehension that produces a list of the first character of each string in doctor look like? 
# Note that the list comprehension uses doc as the iterator variable. What will the output be?


# The list comprehension is [doc[0] for doc in doctor] and produces the list ['h', 'c', 'c', 't', 'w'].
