# Another way of handling missing values is to replace them all with the same value. 
# For numerical variables, one option is to replace values with 0â€” you'll do this here. 
# However, when you replace missing values, you make assumptions about what a missing value means. 
# In this case, you will assume that a missing number sold means that no sales for that avocado type were made that week.

# In this exercise, you'll see how replacing missing values can affect the distribution of a variable using histograms. 
# You can plot histograms for multiple variables at a time as follows:

# dogs[["height_cm", "weight_kg"]].hist()
# pandas has been imported as pd and matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt. 
# The avocados_2016 dataset is available.

# Instructions 1
# A list has been created, cols_with_missing, containing the names of columns with missing values: "small_sold", "large_sold", and "xl_sold".
# Create a histogram of those columns.
# Show the plot.

# List the columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = ["small_sold", "large_sold", "xl_sold"]

# Create histograms showing the distributions cols_with_missing
avocados_2016[cols_with_missing].hist()

# Show the plot
plt.show()


# Instructions 2
# Replace the missing values of avocados_2016 with 0s and store the result as avocados_filled.
# Create a histogram of the cols_with_missing columns of avocados_filled.

# From previous step
cols_with_missing = ["small_sold", "large_sold", "xl_sold"]
avocados_2016[cols_with_missing].hist()
plt.show()

# Fill in missing values with 0
avocados_filled = avocados_2016.fillna(0)

# Create histograms of the filled columns
avocados_filled[cols_with_missing].hist()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
