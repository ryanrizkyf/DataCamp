# Summary statistics can also be calculated on date columns that have values with the data type datetime64. 
# Some summary statistics — like mean — don't make a ton of sense on dates, but others are super helpful, 
# for example, minimum and maximum, which allow you to see what time range your data covers.

# sales is available and pandas is loaded as pd.
import pandas as pd
sales = pd.read_csv('sales_subset.csv')

# Instructions
# Print the maximum of the date column.
# Print the minimum of the date column.

# Print the maximum of the date column
print(sales['date'].max())

# Print the minimum of the date column
print(sales['date'].min())

# Super summarizing! 
# Taking the minimum and maximum of a column of dates is handy for figuring out what time period your data covers. 
# In this case, there are data from February of 2010 to October of 2012.
