# Summary statistics are exactly what they sound like - they summarize many numbers in one statistic. 
# For example, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation are summary statistics. 
# Calculating summary statistics allows you to get a better sense of your data, even if there's a lot of it.

# sales is available and pandas is loaded as pd.
import pandas as pd
sales = pd.read_csv('sales_subset.csv')

# Instructions
# Explore your new DataFrame first by printing the first few rows of the sales DataFrame.
# Print information about the columns in sales.
# Print the mean of the weekly_sales column.
# Print the median of the weekly_sales column.

# Print the head of the sales DataFrame
print(sales.head())

# Print the info about the sales DataFrame
print(sales.info())

# Print the mean of weekly_sales
print(sales['weekly_sales'].mean())

# Print the median of weekly_sales
print(sales['weekly_sales'].median())

# The mean weekly sales amount is almost double the median weekly sales amount! 
# This can tell you that there are a few very high sales weeks that are making the mean so much higher than the median.
