# To add comments to your Python script, you can use the # tag. 
# These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result. 
# As an example, take the comment in the editor, # Division; it is completely ignored during execution.

# Division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition
print(7 + 10)
