# In the video, Hugo briefly examined the return behavior of the built-in functions print() and str(). 
# Here, you will use both functions and examine their return values. 
# A variable x has been preloaded for this exercise. 
# 
# Run the code below in the console. 
# Pay close attention to the results to answer the question that follows.

# Assign str(x) to a variable y1: y1 = str(x)
# Assign print(x) to a variable y2: y2 = print(x)

# Check the types of the variables x, y1, and y2.
# What are the types of x, y1, and y2?

x = 4.89
y1 = str(x)
y2 = print(x)

print(type(x))
print(type(y1))
print(type(y2))
